The [DevoWorm](https://devoworm.weebly.com/) group has two new students that will be working over this summer on topics in computational embryogenesis. To begin their projects, I have asked each student to prepare a short presentation based on their original proposal, which serves as a variant of the traditional ["Hello World" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program). We will then compare this talk with one they will give at the end of the summer to evaluate their learning and accomplishment trajectory.

One student ([Siddharth Yadav](https://github.com/geekSiddharth?tab=following), who is a current [Google Summer of Code student](http://syntheticdaisies.blogspot.com/2017/05/announcing-our-google-summer-of-code.html)) is interested in pursuing work in computer vision, machine learning, and data science, while the other ([Josh Desmond](https://github.com/SkiingxMoose), a Google Summer of Code applicant) is interested in pursuing work in computational biology and modeling/simulation. You may view their presentations (about 20 minutes each) below, and follow along with their progress at the [DevoWorm Github repository](https://github.com/devoworm) [1].

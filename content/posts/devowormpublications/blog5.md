 2021 has been a busy year for the [DevoLearn](https://github.com/DevoLearn/) initiative. Not only has [Mayukh Deb](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/) been busy maintaining and generating new versions of the [DevoLearn pre-trained model](https://pypi.org/project/devolearn/), but I ([Bradly Alicea](https://bradly-alicea.weebly.com/)) has been engaging in [technology evangelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist) to advance awareness and involvement in the initiative.  The DevoLearn pre-trained model software ([for C. elegans embryogenesis](https://thenode.biologists.com/pre-trained-machine-learning-models-for-developmental-biology/uncategorized/)) is now at version 0.3.0, and has garnered [12 contributors making 165 commits](https://libraries.io/github/DevoLearn/devolearn/contributors) (largely since January 2021). Our involvement in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) has bolstered many of these contributions. While our popularity is currently limited, we are trying to spread the word.

To that end, we have presented two versions of a promotional talk on using DevoLearn for facilitating Computational Developmental Biology research and education. The first presentation ([DevoLearn: Engaging learners with Computational Developmental Biology](https://github.com/devoworm/Proposals-Public-Lectures/blob/master/Open%20Education%20Conference/Abstract-Slides.md)) is a flash talk given to the [OSF Education Un-conference on Open Scholarship Practices in Education Research](https://www.cos.io/education-reseach-2021-virtual-unconference), held in February. The second presentation was a longer (15-minute) presentation to the [INCF Assembly](https://neuroinformatics.incf.org/) ([DevoLearn: a platform for open Developmental Data Science, Machine Learning, and Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kg3rgjFCnc&t=2s)), held in April.

As for developing the broader platform, [Ujjwal Singh](https://ujjwalll.github.io/) and I will be working this Summer to develop algorithms for colony morphogenesis and behavior in the Diatom genus Bacillaria. This will be added to the platform in a manner similar to the DevoLearn pre-trained model. In addition to the software development activities, Mayukh, myself, and [Krishna Katyal](https://github.com/krishnakatyal) have been the main contributors to the [DevoWorm Onboarding Guide](https://github.com/devoworm/Proposals-Public-Lectures/blob/master/Onboarding%20Guide/onboarding-guide.md). Looking forward to an exciting future!

Update, 8/19:

All of this work has paid off! From the #devolearn Slack channel ([OpenWorm Slack team](https://app.slack.com/client/T02EPNETZ/)).

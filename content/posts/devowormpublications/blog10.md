Welcome to [Open Data Day 2019](https://opendataday.org/), sponsored by [Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory!](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/) This year we are introducing an open data repository called [DevoZoo](https://devoworm.github.io/devozoo.htm). Based on work going on in the [DevoWorm group](https://devoworm.weebly.com/), DevoZoo include various primary, secondary, and tertiary datasets from a variety of developing organisms (all characterizing embryogenesis). There are several other tabs on the site, including references on C. elegans developmental biology (the embryo image), a collection of Jupyter notebooks ([DevoNotes](https://devoworm.github.io/devo-notes.htm)), methods developed within the DevoWorm group ([DevoMethods](https://devoworm.github.io/devo-methods.htm)), and an educational curriculum ([DevoWormU](https://devoworm.github.io/devoworm-u.htm)).

DevoZoo is based on the ["Models for Data Recycling"](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Models-for-Data-Reuse) mini-grant submitted to (but not funded by) Mozilla Science a few months ago. If you want to understand the greater vision for this initiative, please read over the grant proposal document. Feel free to contribute by playing with the datasets, or by proposing new resources by forking our [Github repository](https://github.com/devoworm/Open-Data-Day) and [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/wiki/A-step-by-step-guide-on-preparing-and-submitting-a-pull-request).
